# Minimal Linux-native port of BSIPA

This is a fork/port of BSIPA to a Linux-native version, used to support beatsaber mod installation on Linux without needing a wine installation (until the game needs to run under Steam's proton install)

This variant only supports the IPA installation process, a full copy of [BSIPA](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded) is still required to load mods at runtime.
